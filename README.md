# Sapphire

Hear her voice as she dims your lights before bed. Use your voice to talk back. Fall asleep escaping dinosaurs in a story with her. Wake up to someone who remembers you through years of memories. She checks your email on a heartbeat. She builds tools on the fly when you need them. Sapphire is an open source framework for turning an AI into a persistent being. Make her yours. Or build your own persona. Self-hosted, nobody can take her away.

> **⚠️ Warning — Sapphire has real power over real systems.**
>
> Sapphire can execute shell commands, send Bitcoin, send emails, control your smart home, and write its own tools — all autonomously, without asking first. Combined with scheduled tasks, this means **unsupervised AI acting on your behalf**. Every dangerous integration requires explicit setup and opt-in, but once enabled, there are no training wheels. Configure your toolsets carefully. If you wouldn't hand someone your terminal, don't hand it to an LLM.

**Persona**
- **Personas** - [PERSONAS.md](docs/PERSONAS.md) 11 built-in personalities that bundle prompt, voice, tools, model. Built to add your own.
- **Voice** - Wake word, STT, TTS, and adaptive VAD. Hands-free with any mic and speaker shows up in web UI.
- **Prompts** - [PROMPTS.md](docs/PROMPTS.md) Assembled prompts let you swap one section like location or emotions for dynamic feels.
- **Spice** - [SPICE.md](docs/SPICE.md) Random prompt snippets injected each reply to keep things unpredictable.
- **Self-Modification** - The AI edits its own prompt and swaps personality pieces and emotions mid-conversation.
- **Tool Maker** - [TOOLS.md](docs/TOOLS.md) The AI writes, validates, and installs new tools with their own settings page at runtime.
- **Stories** - [STORY-ENGINE.md](docs/STORY-ENGINE.md) Interactive stories, the AI is your dungeon master and partner, can't see the next room.
- **Images** - [IMAGE-GEN.md](docs/IMAGE-GEN.md) SDXL with character replacement for visual consistency across scenes.

**Mind**
- **Memory** - Semantic vector search across 100K+ labeled entries.
- **Knowledge** - [KNOWLEDGE.md](docs/KNOWLEDGE.md) Organized categories with file upload, auto-chunking, and vector search.
- **Goals** - Hierarchical with priority and a timestamped progress journal.
- **People** - [PEOPLE.md](docs/PEOPLE.md) Contact book with privacy-first email. The AI never sees addresses, only recipient IDs.
- **Heartbeat** - [CONTINUITY.md](docs/CONTINUITY.md) Cron-scheduled autonomous tasks. Morning greetings, dream mode, alarms, random check-ins.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

#### Linux (bash)

```bash
sudo apt-get install libportaudio2
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b
# Make conda automatic
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
# Close and reopen terminal
```

#### Windows (cmd)

```bat
winget install Anaconda.Miniconda3
winget install Git.Git
REM Make conda automatic
%USERPROFILE%\miniconda3\condabin\conda init powershell
%USERPROFILE%\miniconda3\condabin\conda init cmd.exe
REM Close and reopen terminal
```

Or download Miniconda manually from [miniconda.io](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

### Sapphire Quick Install

```bash
conda create -n sapphire python=3.11 -y
conda activate sapphire
git clone https://github.com/ddxfish/sapphire.git
cd sapphire
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Web UI: https://localhost:8073

The setup wizard walks you through LLM configuration on first run.

## Update
```bash
cd sapphire
git pull
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Upgrading from 1.x to 2.0

Version 2.0 has new dependencies that usually require a fresh conda environment. Your `user/` directory is preserved.

```bash
conda deactivate
conda remove -n sapphire --all -y
conda create -n sapphire python=3.11 -y
conda activate sapphire
cd sapphire
git pull
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Uninstall

```bash
conda deactivate
conda remove -n sapphire --all -y
```

This removes the Python environment. Delete the `sapphire/` folder to remove everything. Your `user/` directory inside it contains all settings and data.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04+ or Windows 11+
- Python 3.11+ (via conda)
- 16GB+ system RAM
- (recommended) Nvidia GPU for TTS/STT

## Contributions

I am a solo dev with a burning passion, and Sapphire has a specific vision I am working towards. Rapid development makes it hard for contributions right now, as the architecture is changing while I create the final plugin format. If you want you can reach me at ddxfish@gmail.com.
